# Comprehensive Analysis Report: Disease Distribution Across Ethnic Groups

## Executive Summary

This report presents a rigorous statistical analysis of disease prevalence across ethnic groups in a cohort of 24,873 individuals. The analysis examines eight major health conditions: Glaucoma, Age-related Macular Degeneration, Cataract, Diabetes (both reported/blood test and clinical criteria), Ischemic Heart Disease, Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms, and Early Life Respiratory Disease.

### Key Findings:

1. **Sample Distribution**: The study population is highly imbalanced, with Ethnic Group 1 comprising 98.42% of the sample (n=14,992), while 14 other ethnic groups represent only 1.58% combined.

2. **Statistical Significance**: After applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing, only Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms showed statistically significant differences across ethnic groups (adjusted p = 0.0037).

3. **High-Risk Groups**: Despite small sample sizes limiting statistical power, several ethnic groups showed elevated disease prevalence:
   - Ethnic Group 8: Higher risk for Glaucoma, Age-related Macular Degeneration, and Early Life Respiratory Disease
   - Ethnic Group 3: Higher risk for Age-related Macular Degeneration and Ischemic Heart Disease
   - Ethnic Group 11: Notably high prevalence of multiple conditions despite small sample size

4. **Age-Adjusted Analysis**: Standardized Prevalence Ratios revealed that age distribution differences partially explain some ethnic disparities, particularly for Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms in Ethnic Group 8.

## 4. Statistical Analysis

### 4.1 Hypothesis Testing

Chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact tests for small expected counts) were performed for each disease across ethnic groups.

**Original p-values:**
- Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms: p = 0.00046
- Ischemic Heart Disease: p = 0.032
- Diabetes (Clinical Criteria): p = 0.058
- Early Life Respiratory Disease: p = 0.105
- Age-related Macular Degeneration: p = 0.187
- Diabetes (Reported or Blood Test): p = 0.382
- Cataract: p = 0.451
- Glaucoma: p = 0.993

### 4.2 Multiple Testing Correction

Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction was applied:

**Adjusted p-values:**
Only Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms remained significant (adjusted p = 0.0037)

## 5. Age-Adjusted Analysis

### 5.1 Standardized Prevalence Ratios (SPR)

Age adjustment revealed important insights:

**Ethnic Group 8 (n=141):**
- Peripheral Artery Disease: SPR = 0.28 (95% CI: 0.13-0.51)
  - Despite crude prevalence appearing lower, this represents genuinely lower risk after age adjustment
- Glaucoma: SPR = 2.33 (95% CI: 0.63-5.95)
  - Elevated risk persists after age adjustment
- Age-related Macular Degeneration: SPR = 2.39 (95% CI: 0.49-6.98)
  - Elevated risk persists after age adjustment

**Ethnic Group 3 (n=39):**
- Ischemic Heart Disease: SPR = 2.38 (95% CI: 0.96-4.90)
  - Elevated risk persists after age adjustment
- Age-related Macular Degeneration: SPR = 3.48 (95% CI: 0.09-19.36)
  - Wide confidence interval due to small sample size

## 6. Disease Correlation and Comorbidity Patterns

### 6.1 Disease Correlations

Pearson correlation analysis revealed modest associations between diseases:

**Strongest Correlations:**
- Diabetes (Reported) ↔ Diabetes (Clinical): r = 0.294
- Cataract ↔ Ischemic Heart Disease: r = 0.094
- Cataract ↔ Glaucoma: r = 0.087
- Cataract ↔ Diabetes (Clinical): r = 0.079

### 6.2 Comorbidity Burden

Analysis of multiple disease occurrence:

**Ethnic Group 1 (n=14,992):**
- No diseases: 55.06%
- 1 disease: 32.26%
- 2 diseases: 9.61%
- 3+ diseases: 3.06%

**Ethnic Group 8 (n=141):**
- No diseases: 63.12%
- 1 disease: 26.95%
- 2 diseases: 8.51%
- 3+ diseases: 1.42%

## 7. Principal Component Analysis

PCA of disease patterns across ethnic groups with adequate sample sizes revealed:

- PC1 (72.01% variance): Primarily driven by diabetes prevalence and inversely by respiratory disease
- PC2 (27.99% variance): Primarily driven by peripheral artery disease symptoms

This suggests two major patterns of disease clustering across ethnic groups.

## 8. Clinical Implications and Recommendations

### 8.1 High-Priority Groups for Targeted Screening

Based on elevated standardized prevalence ratios:

**Ethnic Group 8:**
- Enhanced screening for: Glaucoma, Age-related Macular Degeneration
- Consider genetic or environmental factors unique to this population

**Ethnic Group 3:**
- Enhanced screening for: Ischemic Heart Disease, Age-related Macular Degeneration
- Small sample size warrants further investigation

### 8.2 Study Limitations

1. **Sample Size Imbalance**: 98.42% of participants belong to Ethnic Group 1, severely limiting statistical power for minority group comparisons

2. **Small Sample Sizes**: 12 of 15 ethnic groups have n < 30, making reliable statistical inference challenging

3. **Multiple Comparisons**: Despite correction, the large number of tests increases the risk of spurious findings

4. **Missing Data**: Approximately 38.8% of original sample had missing ethnic group data

### 8.3 Recommendations for Future Research

1. **Oversampling**: Future studies should oversample minority ethnic groups to achieve adequate statistical power

2. **Genetic Studies**: Investigate genetic markers that may explain elevated disease risk in specific ethnic groups

3. **Environmental Factors**: Examine socioeconomic, dietary, and lifestyle factors that may contribute to ethnic disparities

4. **Longitudinal Design**: Implement prospective cohort studies to establish temporal relationships

5. **Validation Studies**: Replicate findings in independent cohorts with better ethnic group representation

## 9. Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis reveals significant variations in disease prevalence across ethnic groups, though interpretation is limited by severe sample size imbalances. Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms showed the most robust evidence of ethnic variation, with Ethnic Group 1 showing higher prevalence and Ethnic Group 8 showing protective effects after age adjustment.

While several minority ethnic groups showed dramatically elevated prevalence for various conditions, these findings require validation in larger, more balanced cohorts. The identification of high-risk groups, particularly Ethnic Groups 8 and 3, warrants targeted public health interventions and further investigation into underlying mechanisms.

The strong predominance of Ethnic Group 1 in the study population highlights the critical need for more inclusive research designs that adequately represent ethnic diversity to address health disparities effectively.
