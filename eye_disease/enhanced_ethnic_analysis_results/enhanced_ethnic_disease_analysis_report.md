## 7. Summary and Clinical Implications

### High-Risk Ethnic Groups (≥50% higher prevalence than overall population)
- Glaucoma: Ethnic Groups 8
- Age-related Macular Degeneration: Ethnic Groups 3, 8
- Cataract: No groups identified as high-risk
- Diabetes (Reported or Blood Test): No groups identified as high-risk
- Diabetes (Clinical Criteria): No groups identified as high-risk
- Ischemic Heart Disease: Ethnic Groups 3
- Peripheral Artery Disease Symptoms: No groups identified as high-risk
- Early Life Respiratory Disease: Ethnic Groups 8

### Key Findings
1. Sample size considerations: Many ethnic groups have small sample sizes, requiring cautious interpretation
2. Statistical significance: Multiple testing correction was applied to control false discovery rate
3. Age adjustment: Standardized prevalence ratios account for age distribution differences
4. Disease clustering: Correlation analysis reveals comorbidity patterns
5. Principal component analysis: Identifies major patterns of disease variation across ethnic groups
